# Advanced Analysis of Hispanic Voters through Sub-Ethnicity Identification
Abstract
Recent electoral polls have tracked Hispanic voters in both Presidential and state elections in an effort to determine what influences voter turnout and trends. The aim of this project is to analyze Hispanic voter trends and to categorize each voter into selected sub-groups based on publicly available census data and voter information to then pinpoint which sub-groups need assistance in increasing the overall Hispanic voter turnout. However, public voter information does not include an individual’s Hispanic sub-group and Hispanic is a broad term to classify any individual from Latin or South America. Census data was used to help determine the number of Hispanic sub-groups and percentages of individuals within each Hispanic sub-group at a given zip code. The process of identifying an individual’s most probable sub-group was determined by creating probability percentages based on their first name, last name(s) and zip code. By calculating percentages of the popularity of a given first name and last name(s) within each of the 19 selected Latin and South American countries, a probability of their sub-ethnicity was calculated after combining it with their zip code. After the development of a model and algorithm, all self-identified Hispanic voters were classified in an effort to begin the process of analyzing Hispanic Voter trends. This data will help reveal the patterns and behaviors of Hispanic sub-group voting trends to then pinpoint which sub-groups need help in participating in local and national elections to then increase the over Hispanic Vote.
